cs 300 finals

    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  This course went over how to build, import, and store data into multiple data storage types. These types included vectors, linked lists, and binary search trees.
  
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I had to learn the differences between all of the stata structures and why one may be used over the others. I used the resources given over the course of this class, as well as google and StackOverflow to learn more about certain topics. It is very important to learn about the different data structures because of how data needs to be stored and retrieved, which is affected by load times and the ability to enter and edit data.
  
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  Some roadblocks, such as time and procrastination, were overcome by staying focused on my work and my ability to portray my ideas as clearly as possible. Planning on when I completed my work and studied for this class was extremely helpfull, too.
  
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  This past project, as well as the various milestones I have completed in this class, helped me understand which data structures could be helpful in my personal development projects.
  
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  My work evlolved the way I write my programs through being more thorough with my comments in my code, where I now explain what the function does, as well as possible errors in my code.
